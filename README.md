<h1 align="center">AgenticLinux</h1>

A Linux desktop built for working with AI agents. Everything is there on
first boot: the `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `openclaw` and `goose` agents,
[herdr](https://herdr.dev) to run them side by side,
[CodexBar](https://codex.bar) to keep an eye on their usage limits, the
[ChatGPT](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/app) (with Codex),
[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and [Goose](https://goose-docs.ai) desktop
apps, Google Chrome,
[llmman](https://github.com/llmmanorg/llmman) to run models locally or connect
any agent to any provider, [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)
(rootful and [rootless](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)) and
[Docker Sandboxes](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/) to run agents in
isolation, [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) with KVM for full virtual machines,
GPU runtimes for Vulkan, ROCm and NVIDIA/CUDA, and a full developer
toolset.

AgenticLinux is a [bootc](https://bootc-dev.github.io/bootc/) image: the whole
OS ships as a container, so updates are atomic and rollback is one command.
It is built from Fedora 44 packages on the
[fedora-ostree-desktops](https://quay.io/organization/fedora-ostree-desktops)
images, or from CentOS Stream 10 packages (with EPEL) on the
[centos-bootc](https://quay.io/repository/centos-bootc/centos-bootc) image,
and available for x86_64 and aarch64.

## Quick start

1. Download the ISO for your desktop and architecture from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/ericcurtin/agenticlinux/releases/latest),
   boot it and install as usual.
2. Add yourself to the `docker` group, then log out and back in (or use
   [rootless Docker](#docker) instead):

   ```sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
   ```

3. Run an agent on a local model, or on any hosted provider:

   ```sh
   llmman launch claude --model qwen3.8
   llmman launch opencode --provider openrouter --model qwen/qwen3-coder
   ```

| Variant      | Built from       | Desktop    | Image                                               |
|--------------|------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| kde          | Fedora 44        | KDE Plasma | `docker.io/ericcurtin044/agenticlinux:kde`          |

| sway         | Fedora 44        | Sway       | `docker.io/ericcurtin044/agenticlinux:sway`         |
| cosmic       | Fedora 44        | COSMIC     | `docker.io/ericcurtin044/agenticlinux:cosmic`       |
| xfce         | Fedora 44        | Xfce       | `docker.io/ericcurtin044/agenticlinux:xfce`         |
| budgie       | Fedora 44        | Budgie     | `docker.io/ericcurtin044/agenticlinux:budgie`       |
| base         | Fedora 44        | none       | `docker.io/ericcurtin044/agenticlinux:base`         |
| centos-kde   | CentOS Stream 10 | KDE Plasma | `docker.io/ericcurtin044/agenticlinux:centos-kde`   |
| centos-gnome | CentOS Stream 10 | GNOME      | `docker.io/ericcurtin044/agenticlinux:centos-gnome` |
| centos-base  | CentOS Stream 10 | none       | `docker.io/ericcurtin044/agenticlinux:centos-base`  |

The variants carry the same packages on both distributions, so the list is
what CentOS Stream 10, EPEL 10 and RPM Fusion have: GNOME and KDE Plasma are
the desktops that exist there. CentOS Stream's kernel tracks the next RHEL
10 minor release.

## Signing in to the agents

On a local model, through `llmman launch`, the agents need no account.
Otherwise sign in once per agent:

- `claude`: log in in the browser on first run, or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- `codex`: `codex login`, or `printenv OPENAI_API_KEY | codex login --with-api-key`.
- `opencode`: `/connect` in its TUI.
- `openclaw`: `openclaw onboard`.
- `goose`: `goose configure`.
- `llmman`: export the provider's key (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, ...) before
  `llmman launch --provider ...`; `llmman providers` shows which are set.

The ChatGPT app asks you to sign in when it first starts. Credentials stay in
your home directory, which [updates](#updates) leave alone.

## Desktop apps

The desktop apps of the agents that publish an RPM are installed from it,
and start from the applications menu or as `chatgpt`, `opencode-desktop` and
`goose-desktop`:

- **ChatGPT**: OpenAI's one desktop app, which is also the Codex app (the
  "Codex" mode inside it). Its Linux build is a preview.
- **OpenCode**: relocated from `/opt` to `/usr/lib` so it is part of the
  image rather than of the machine's first install.
- **Goose**: its RPM installs under `/usr/lib` and carries the `goose`
  CLI, which `/usr/bin/goose` links to, so the CLI and the app are always
  the same version.

**CodexBar** shows the agents' usage limits and spend in the tray, or with
`codexbar usage` in a terminal. It starts at login (see its Settings); GNOME
needs a tray extension for the icon.

The apps live in the read-only `/usr`, so nothing in them can update itself
in place: they are updated with the image, like everything else.

## Docker

Two daemons, with separate images and containers:

- **Rootful**: the system `docker.service`, for members of the `docker`
  group. It is the CLI's `default` context and has the NVIDIA runtime
  (`--gpus all`).
- **Rootless**: a daemon per user, without root privileges. Set it up once
  (add `--force` if you are in the `docker` group):

  ```sh
  dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
  ```

  This starts it as a systemd user service and switches the CLI to its
  `rootless` context. Switch back with `docker context use default`. To
  keep it running after logout, run `sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"`.

## Install

The ISO is a network installer preset to pull the matching image from Docker
Hub, so the install needs a network connection; disk, user and locale are
chosen in the installer as usual, with plain xfs partitions as the default.

Or switch an existing bootc system:

```sh
sudo bootc switch docker.io/ericcurtin044/agenticlinux:kde
```

The root filesystem (which holds `/var`, `/home` and `/root`) defaults to xfs
for both `bootc install` and the ISO.

The images are not signed: pulling one, from the ISO or `bootc switch`, relies
on Docker Hub over HTTPS.

## Updates

The whole OS is one image, rebuilt every 4 hours and on every push to `main`;
the variant's tag (`kde`) is the newest. `/etc` and `/var` (so your home
directory) carry over between images.

```sh
bootc status                # running, staged and rollback images
sudo bootc upgrade          # fetch the newest image, boot into it next time
sudo bootc upgrade --apply  # the same, and reboot now
sudo bootc rollback         # boot the previous image next time; again to undo
```

`/var` is shared by both images, so a rollback does not undo changes to your
data.

Every build is also tagged `<variant>-<version>`, the name of a
[release](https://github.com/ericcurtin/agenticlinux/releases). Switch to one
to pin it, and back to the variant's tag to follow the newest:

```sh
sudo bootc switch docker.io/ericcurtin044/agenticlinux:kde-44.YYYYMMDD.N
```

Nothing updates on its own by default. bootc's timer checks an hour after boot
and about every eight hours after that, and reboots as soon as it finds a new
image:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now bootc-fetch-apply-updates.timer
```

## GPUs

- Vulkan: Mesa drivers and `vulkaninfo`.
- ROCm (x86_64): HIP runtime, OpenCL, rocBLAS, hipBLAS, hipBLASLt, RCCL,
  `rocminfo`, `rocm-smi`. Containers get GPU access with
  `--device /dev/kfd --device /dev/dri`.
- ROCm on CentOS Stream is EPEL's build: HIP, rocBLAS, hipBLAS, hipBLASLt,
  RCCL, `rocminfo`, `rocm-smi`; EPEL has no ROCm OpenCL.
- NVIDIA: the RPM Fusion driver with the kernel module prebuilt for the
  image's kernel, CUDA driver libraries and `nvidia-container-toolkit`
  registered with Docker (`docker run --gpus all ...`). The module is
  unsigned, so disable Secure Boot or enroll your own MOK. nouveau is
  blacklisted via kernel arguments. On CentOS Stream the driver is RPM
  Fusion's EL10 build, the 580 series. On aarch64 the driver is best effort:
  when RPM Fusion's aarch64 build is broken the image is published without
  it (and with nouveau), see [build.sh](build.sh).

## Building

[packages.txt](packages.txt) lists the RPMs, [build.sh](build.sh) does the
rest, and `usr/` is copied over the image. Each variant's base image is at the
top of the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile); `VARIANT` must match its distribution. The
published image is the `chunked` target, an OCI layout that Docker only loads
with the containerd image store. Enable it in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```json
{"features": {"containerd-snapshotter": true}}
```

Then:

```sh
docker build --target chunked \
  --build-arg BASE=quay.io/fedora-ostree-desktops/kinoite:44 --build-arg VARIANT=kde \
  -o type=tar,dest=image.tar .
docker load -i image.tar   # loads it as agenticlinux:kde
```

The smoke test runs in a container of the image; it pulls a small local model
and runs each agent on it, so it takes a while:

```sh
docker build -f test/Dockerfile --build-arg IMAGE=agenticlinux:kde -t agenticlinux:smoke .
docker run --rm agenticlinux:smoke smoke-vm
```

CI also boots each x86_64 image in `qemu` with [test/smoke.sh](test/smoke.sh),
which covers what needs a real boot: Docker (rootful and rootless) and podman.
[build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml) publishes only if every variant passes
on both architectures. A fork needs the `DOCKER_HUB_USER` variable, the
`DOCKER_HUB_PAT` secret, and an `assets` release with the logo files, which
`build.sh` downloads from `REPO_URL`.
